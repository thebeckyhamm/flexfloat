##FlexFloat

###A tiny grid system that uses flexbox in browsers that support it

####Dependencies

FlexFloat requires [modernizr](http://modernizr.com/download/).  Add your preferred flavor of modernizr to the `<head>` of your file (make sure you check off Flexible Box Model in the options):

```
<script src="modernizr.min.js"></script>
```

####How to work it
Copy the `.scss` code out of `flexfloat.scss` into your own SASS project and compile.

Or go old school and copy the straight up CSS from `flexfloat.css`.
